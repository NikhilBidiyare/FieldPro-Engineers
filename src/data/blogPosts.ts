    summary: 'Essential components and best practices for creating comprehensive property site visit reports that meet valuation standards and regulatory requirements.',
    content: `
      <p>A comprehensive site visit report is the foundation of accurate property valuation. Having conducted over 2,500 site visits across diverse property types, here's what separates exceptional reports from basic ones.</p>
      
      <h2>Detailed Property Description</h2>
      <p>Every report should include precise measurements, material descriptions, and architectural details. We document not just square footage, but construction quality, finishes, and any modifications that impact value.</p>
      
      <h2>Photographic Documentation</h2>
      <p>High-quality photographs are essential. We typically capture 30-50 images per property, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exterior views from multiple angles</li>
        <li>Interior rooms showing condition and finishes</li>
        <li>Mechanical systems and utilities</li>
        <li>Any defects or maintenance issues</li>
        <li>Neighborhood context and comparables</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Condition Assessment</h2>
      <p>We provide detailed condition ratings using standardized scales, noting any deferred maintenance, structural issues, or code violations that could affect valuation.</p>
      
      <h2>Neighborhood Analysis</h2>
      <p>Context matters in valuation. Our reports include observations about neighborhood trends, comparable properties, and local market conditions that influence property value.</p>
      
      <h2>Compliance Verification</h2>
      <p>We verify permits, check for code compliance, and identify any legal or zoning issues that could impact marketability or value.</p>
